/**
 * @brief Executes asynchronously an I/0 operation on the given file descriptor.
 * This function creates an asynchronous select request for the given file descriptor and then suspends the execution
 * of the current Java thread using SNI_suspendCurrentJavaThreadWithCallback().
 * Once the file descriptor of the request will be ready for the given operation or the timeout is reached, the Java
 * thread is resumed and the given SNI callback is called.
 *
 * <code>absolute_timeout_ms</code> is an absolute time in milliseconds computed from the system time returned by
 * <code>LLMJVM_IMPL_getCurrentTime(1)</code>. A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.
 *
 * @param[in] fd the file descriptor.
 * @param[in] operation the operation (read or write) we want to monitor with the select().
 * @param[in] absolute_timeout_ms the absolute timeout in millisecond or 0 if no timeout.
 * @param[in] callback the SNI callback to call when the Java thread is resumed or timeout occurs.
 * @param[in] callback_suspend_arg the SNI suspend callback argument.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, -1 on failure.
 *
 * @note Throws NativeIOException on failure.
 *
 * @warning: This function needs to register the created asynchronous select request as a scoped native resource.
 * Since several scoped native resources cannot be registered in the same native context, the function <code>SNI_unregisterScopedResource()</code>
 * is called to unregister a potential existing scoped resource before registering the new one.
 * Make sure that no scoped resource is registered before calling this function otherwise it will be unregistered.
 * <code>SNI_getScopedResource()</code> can be called to check if there is an existing scoped resource.
