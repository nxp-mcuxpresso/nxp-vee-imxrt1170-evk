# VG Test Suite

This folder contains a ready-to-use project for testing [MicroVG](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/VEEPortingGuide/vg.html) implementations on a device.
This Test Suite will test vector drawing capabilities.

## Specifications

- Tested Foundation Library: [MicroVG](https://repository.microej.com/modules/ej/api/microvg/)
- Test Suite Module: [com.microej.pack.vg#vg-testsuite](https://repository.microej.com/modules/com/microej/pack/vg/vg-testsuite/)

Set the VG Test Suite module version in the [build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts) to match the pack version of the VEE Port
tested.

The test suite evolves as the VG Pack evolves: bug fixes, new features, etc.
A test suite is, therefore, compatible with a given range of VG Packs (cf VG Pack changelog: https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/VEEPortingGuide/vgChangeLog.html).
The following table shows the relationship between the different versions of the test suite and the associated VG Packs.
(note: Each VG Pack implements a version of MicroVG; cf VG Pack release notes: https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/VEEPortingGuide/vgReleaseNotes.html).

The table indicates:

* the version of the project `java-testsuite-runner-vg`,
* the version of the test suite library fetched by the project `java-testsuite-runner-vg`,
* the compatible VG Packs to run the tests of the test suite,
* the minimum version of the MicroVG API required by the test suite.

| Project version | TestSuite version | VG Pack Range   | MicroVG API Range |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1.4.0           | 4.0.0             | [1.7.0-2.0.0[   | [1.5.0-2.0.0[     |

|                 | 2.7.0             | [1.5.1-2.0.0[   | [1.4.0-2.0.0[     |
| 1.2.0           | 2.6.0             | [1.5.0-2.0.0[   | [1.4.0-2.0.0[     |
| 1.1.0           | 2.5.0             | [1.4.2-2.0.0[   | [1.4.0-2.0.0[     |
| 1.0.0           | 2.2.0             | [1.3.0-2.0.0[   | [1.3.0-2.0.0[     |

## Requirements

See VEE Port Test Suites [documentation](../README.md).

## Skip Tests

Some tests might be skipped according to:

* The VEE Port: Some features are tested (like external resources: images and fonts stored outside the CPU address range). If the VEE Port does not provide an external resource loader, some tests must be skipped.
* The target, embedded or simulator. The simulator can skip some tests (approximation issues, useless feature like external resources management, known issues).
* The GPU: The MicroVG testsuite checks all the MicroVG specification. A GPU may not support some drawings, for instance the usage of some blending modes. By consequence, the associated tests must be skipped.

The MicroVG testsuite provides dedicated settings files for:

* the Vivante VGLite GPU
* the Think Silicon NemaVG GPU
* the MicroEJ Simulator

These files allow to skip the irrelevant tests according to the target.
The content of a file must be copied into the `config.properties` file.
These files are available in the MicroVG testsuite JAR file, in the folder `settings`.

This is an example of property to skip the test `TestPath.testVeryLongDynamicPath()`:

```
microej.testsuite.properties.microej.java.property.tests.TestPath.testVeryLongDynamicPath.skip=true
```

## Usage

- Follow the configuration and execution steps described in VEE Port Test Suites [documentation](../README.md).
